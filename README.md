### Welcome to tic-tac-toe! ###

This application allows users to play a 'Single Player' game on easy mode (random choice of piece by computer) and also a 'Two Player' mode where pieces to be placed on the board alternate per turn. The player(s) are given the option to restart the game after each game is completed. A game is considered completed when a player achieves in placing three consecutive pieces on the board or when the board is full.

tic-tac-toe is written using the React framework and Less as a css-preprocessor. gulpfile.js uses Gulp to run the automation workflow tool used to bundle and babelify of React's JSX and .less files to .css.
